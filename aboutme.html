	<p>My name is Amaan.I am a student of CS.I kind of like the subjects which I am Studying because these subjects build me to become a professional in those fields.
	I can say that I am a responsible and a hard-working person. Moreover, I have many friends since I like to communicate with people and get to know new interesting individuals. I enjoy my time at collage: it is really nice to study, the students are very friendly and ready to help. The atmosphere cannot but make me want to go there every time. </p>
